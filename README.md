# Pythonistas- Python Hackathon Sep 2022

In this Python Hackathon Sep 2022,we Pythonistas were able to flex our Python skills as well as creativity. In this Hackathon, the objective was to analyse and visualize the HospitalDatabase using python libraries. This hackathon gave us a deep understanding on Python and it gave us a practical knowledge of Python for visualization and analysing data. 
For project management, we first created a GIT repository(Pythonistas).Then we created a develop and master branch .So once we started working,we created a local desktop folder for each of the four team members. Then opened the GitHub from the local system and made a sync with remote repository by cloning the repository. Once , each members' work is done, she will pull the remote repository and  made add /commits and pushed the changes to the master. We always made sure that we are pushing everything to the master which indeed reflects on develop branch. We continued working this way throughout the hackathon. For implementing Agile methodology, we used Trello board, where we were assigned our tasks by our Product owner. As we progressed , we moved the tasks accordingly. Once we have completed the 80 questions ,we tried to do 23 more questions where we find its fun and challenging.

We imported the following lPython Libraries for our project
* pandas 
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* numpy
* datetime
* timedelta
* warnings
* ipywidgets

Using these libraries we were able to finish all the 80 questions and we were able to explore on some other interatice plots on the 23 extra questions.
